This Python code simulates a two-player math game where players take turns removing perfect squares from a pile of
 numbers.
The game starts by prompting the user to enter a non-square number between 10 and 1000. Perfect squares are integers
 which can be obtained by squaring an integer (e.g., 4 is a perfect square because 2 * 2 = 4). Once a valid number is
  entered, the game begins.

On each turn, a player is prompted to enter a valid perfect square to remove from the pile. Valid perfect squares are
 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on. The player cannot enter a number greater than the remaining number of squares in the pile.
  After a valid square is entered, it is subtracted from the pile.

The game continues until the pile reaches zero. The player who removes the last perfect square wins the game!
